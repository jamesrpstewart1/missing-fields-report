## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-09

### Added
- **ðŸŽ¯ Severity Filtering System**: Comprehensive severity-based incident filtering
  - Configurable severity level filtering for both incident.io and FireHydrant platforms
  - Platform-specific severity configurations with granular control
  - Support for incident.io "Internal Impact" severity variants
  - Enable/disable functionality via Config sheet parameters

### Enhanced
- **ðŸ“Š Summary Tab**: Added severity filtering status and criteria display in Executive Summary
- **ðŸ“§ Email Reports**: Enhanced email notifications with severity filtering information
  - HTML and plain text formats include filtering status and criteria
  - Clear indication of enabled/disabled state and impact
- **ðŸ“‹ Tracking Sheet**: New Severity column for better incident visibility
  - Cross-platform severity extraction with `getIncidentSeverity()` function
  - Updated headers and formatting for enhanced data presentation

### Technical Implementation
- **New Functions**:
  - `matchesIncidentIOSeverity()`: Platform-specific severity matching for incident.io
  - `matchesFireHydrantSeverity()`: Platform-specific severity matching for FireHydrant
  - `getSeverityFilteringSummary()`: Consistent severity status reporting
  - `getIncidentSeverity()`: Cross-platform severity extraction
- **Enhanced Functions**:
  - Updated `fetchIncidentsFromIncidentIO()` and `fetchIncidentsFromFireHydrant()` with filtering logic
  - Enhanced `updateTrackingSheet()` with severity column support
  - Improved `generateTieredEmailContent()` with severity information

### Configuration
- **New Config Parameters**:
  - `enableSeverityFiltering`: Boolean to enable/disable severity filtering
  - `incidentioSeverities`: Array of incident.io severities to include (e.g., SEV0,SEV1,SEV2)
  - `includeInternalImpact`: Boolean to include Internal Impact severity variants
  - `firehydrantSeverities`: Array of FireHydrant severities to include
- **Backward Compatibility**: All new features disabled by default, maintaining existing behavior

### Testing & Validation
- **New Testing Function**: `testSeverityFiltering()` for comprehensive severity filtering validation
- **Menu Integration**: Added severity filtering test to Testing & Research submenu
- **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced logging for severity filtering decisions and impact

### Documentation
- **Enhanced README Sheet**: Comprehensive severity filtering documentation
  - Configuration examples and parameter descriptions
  - Behavior explanations for enabled/disabled states
  - Troubleshooting guidance for severity filtering issues
- **Updated Project Documentation**: README.md updated with severity filtering capabilities

### Files Modified
- `src/apps-script/Config.gs`: Core configuration management and utility functions
- `src/apps-script/IncidentAPI.gs`: Platform-specific filtering logic implementation
- `src/apps-script/EmailService.gs`: Email template enhancements with severity info
- `src/apps-script/Code.gs`: Testing functions and menu system updates

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- **New Field Validation**: Impact Start Date/Time via incident.io V2 timestamps endpoint
- **New Field Validation**: Incident Transcript URL via "Google Meet Transcript" custom field
- Enhanced Summary tab reporting with 5-field analysis (previously 3 fields)
- Dynamic total incidents display based on configurable lookback days
- V2 Incident Timestamps API integration for precise impact timing
- Custom field lookup system for transcript URL retrieval

### Changed
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced runtime from 10+ minutes to ~69 seconds
- Updated field validation logic to handle 5 required fields instead of 3
- Enhanced Summary sheet formatting with improved readability for TOTAL rows
- Executive Summary now shows dynamic date ranges based on configuration
- Improved error handling for V2 API endpoint calls

### Fixed
- Configuration reading for `maxLookbackDays` parameter
- Summary sheet formatting issues with expanded field list
- Bold formatting removed from field names for consistency
- Row numbering alignment in Summary sheet formatting

### Technical Improvements
- Added `getImpactStartTimestamp()` function for V2 API integration
- Enhanced `getIncidentIOFieldValue()` with custom field support
- Updated `analyzeIncidents()` and `buildMissingFieldRows()` for 5-field analysis
- Optimized API call patterns to reduce execution time
- Improved field validation performance and reliability

### Documentation
- Updated README with new field requirements
- Enhanced system documentation with V2 API details
- Added troubleshooting guide for new field validation
