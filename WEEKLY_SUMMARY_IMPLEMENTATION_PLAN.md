# Weekly Summary Report Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding weekly summary functionality to the existing Missing Fields Report system. The new feature will provide:

1. **Count of incidents opened** in the past week
2. **Percentage completion of essential fields** across all incidents
3. **Business unit breakdown** of metrics
4. **Weekly email reports** with executive-level summaries
5. **Automated weekly scheduling** (every Monday at 9:00 AM)

## Design Approach

### ✅ Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-Breaking Integration**: The weekly functionality will be added alongside existing daily reports without affecting current operations
2. **Reuse Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing API functions, field validation, and email systems
3. **Separate Report Type**: Weekly reports focus on **completion rates** rather than missing fields
4. **Executive Summary Format**: Weekly emails provide high-level metrics suitable for leadership

### 📊 Weekly Report Focus

**Daily Reports** (Current):
- Focus on incidents **with missing fields**
- Detailed tracking of incomplete incidents
- Action-oriented for incident responders

**Weekly Reports** (New):
- Focus on **overall field completion rates**
- Executive summary of incident documentation quality
- Strategic view for management

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Weekly Functions to Code.gs

Add the following functions from `weekly-summary-enhancement.js`:

```javascript
// Core weekly report functions
- runWeeklySummaryReport()
- generateWeeklySummary()
- weeklyAutomatedSummary()

// Weekly automation management
- setupWeeklyAutomation()
- cancelWeeklyAutomation()
- showWeeklyAutomationStatus()

// Utility functions
- logWeeklyExecution()
- updateSummarySheetWithWeeklySummary()
```

### Step 2: Update Menu System in Code.gs

Replace the existing `createCustomMenu()` function with `createCustomMenuWithWeekly()` to add:

```
📊 Weekly Summary Report
├── 📊 Generate Weekly Summary Now
├── 🔧 Setup Weekly Automation
├── 🛑 Cancel Weekly Automation
└── 📊 Show Weekly Status
```

### Step 3: Add Email Templates to EmailService.gs

Add the following functions:

```javascript
- sendWeeklySummaryEmail()
- buildWeeklySummaryEmailContent()
```

### Step 4: Test Implementation

1. **Manual Testing**: Run `runWeeklySummaryReport()` manually
2. **Email Testing**: Verify weekly email format and content
3. **Automation Testing**: Set up and verify weekly triggers
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure daily reports remain unaffected

## Key Metrics in Weekly Report

### 📈 Executive Summary
- **Total Incidents Opened**: Count of all incidents in the past 7 days
- **Field Completion Rate**: Percentage of incidents with all required fields complete
- **Complete Incidents**: Count of incidents with all fields populated
- **Incomplete Incidents**: Count of incidents missing one or more fields

### 🏢 Business Unit Breakdown
For each business unit (Square, Cash, Afterpay):
- Total incidents opened
- Complete incidents count
- Incomplete incidents count
- Completion percentage

### ⚠️ Top Missing Fields
- Ranked list of most commonly missing fields
- Count of incidents missing each field

## Email Template Features

### 📧 Professional HTML Format
- Executive-friendly layout with key metrics prominently displayed
- Color-coded business unit sections
- Responsive design for mobile viewing
- Clear call-to-action for incomplete incidents

### 📊 Visual Elements
- Large metric displays for key numbers
- Color coding (green for complete, red for incomplete)
- Professional table layouts
- Business unit color coding (Square: blue, Cash: orange, Afterpay: green)

## Automation Configuration

### 📅 Weekly Schedule
- **Frequency**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM
- **Trigger Function**: `weeklyAutomatedSummary()`
- **Date Range**: Past 7 days (Monday to Sunday)

### ⚙️ Management Functions
- **Setup**: `setupWeeklyAutomation()` - Creates weekly trigger
- **Cancel**: `cancelWeeklyAutomation()` - Removes weekly triggers
- **Status**: `showWeeklyAutomationStatus()` - Shows current automation state

## Data Processing Logic

### 📊 Weekly Data Collection

1. **Date Range Calculation**:
   ```javascript
   const endDate = new Date();
   const startDate = new Date(Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
   ```

2. **Incident Fetching**:
   - Reuse existing `fetchIncidentsFromIncidentIOWithDateRange()`
   - Reuse existing `fetchIncidentsFromFireHydrantWithDateRange()`
   - Filter incidents created within the past 7 days

3. **Field Validation**:
   - Use existing `validateRequiredFields()` function
   - Separate incidents into complete vs. incomplete categories

4. **Metrics Calculation**:
   - Calculate completion percentages
   - Generate business unit breakdowns
   - Identify top missing fields

## File Modifications Required

### 📁 Code.gs
```javascript
// Add all weekly functions from weekly-summary-enhancement.js
// Replace createCustomMenu() with createCustomMenuWithWeekly()
```

### 📁 EmailService.gs
```javascript
// Add sendWeeklySummaryEmail()
// Add buildWeeklySummaryEmailContent()
```

### 📁 Config.gs (Optional)
```javascript
// Add weekly-specific configuration options if needed
// Currently uses existing email configuration
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Manual Testing
- [ ] Run `runWeeklySummaryReport()` manually
- [ ] Verify weekly metrics calculation
- [ ] Check business unit breakdown accuracy
- [ ] Validate email content and formatting

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the implementation can be easily rolled back:

1. **Remove Weekly Functions**: Delete added functions from Code.gs
2. **Restore Original Menu**: Replace `createCustomMenuWithWeekly()` with original `createCustomMenu()`
3. **Remove Email Templates**: Delete weekly email functions from EmailService.gs
4. **Cancel Triggers**: Run `cancelWeeklyAutomation()` to remove any active weekly triggers
