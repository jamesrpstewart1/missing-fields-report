## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **API Changes**: incident.io or FireHydrant API changes could break integration
   - *Mitigation*: Monitor API documentation, implement robust error handling
2. **Rate Limits**: API rate limiting could cause failures
   - *Mitigation*: Implement proper throttling and retry logic
3. **Email Delivery**: Email delivery failures could cause missed notifications
   - *Mitigation*: Implement fallback notification methods

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Google Apps Script Limits**: Execution time or quota limits
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize code, implement batching
2. **Data Volume**: Large numbers of incidents could cause performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination and efficient filtering
