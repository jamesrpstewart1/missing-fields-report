  - [ ] Map FireHydrant fields to required fields
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and rate limiting

#### 1.3 Google Sheets Setup (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create or configure Google Sheet (ID: 1TF0p345-fZaK5PnR2TgsmskxA_OHfGLyUL4Qp3b99Eg)
- [ ] Set up required sheets: Config, Tracking, Logs, Recipients
- [ ] Configure initial parameters and test data
- [ ] Test Google Apps Script access and permissions

#### 1.4 Field Validation Logic (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Field Mapping Validation**
  - [ ] Test field extraction from incident.io incidents
  - [ ] Test field extraction from FireHydrant incidents
  - [ ] Validate field name variations and edge cases
  - [ ] Implement robust field validation logic

- [ ] **Required Fields Testing**
  - [ ] Test "Affected Markets" field detection
  - [ ] Test "Causal Type" field detection
  - [ ] Test "Stabilization Type" field detection
  - [ ] Handle empty, null, and whitespace-only values

### Phase 2: Integration & End-to-End Testing (Estimated: 1 week)

#### 2.1 Complete System Integration
- [ ] Deploy all Apps Script modules to Google Apps Script
- [ ] Configure all API credentials in Script Properties
- [ ] Test complete workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate email generation and delivery

#### 2.2 Testing Scenarios
- [ ] **Happy Path Testing**
  - [ ] Test with incidents that have all required fields
  - [ ] Test with incidents missing one field
  - [ ] Test with incidents missing multiple fields
  - [ ] Test with incidents from different platforms

- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**
  - [ ] Test with no incidents found
  - [ ] Test with API failures and timeouts
  - [ ] Test with invalid or malformed data
  - [ ] Test with email delivery failures

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - [ ] Test with large numbers of incidents
  - [ ] Validate execution time within Google Apps Script limits
  - [ ] Test rate limiting and API throttling

#### 2.3 Email System Testing
- [ ] Test email template rendering with real data

## Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

### Immediate Technical Debt
- [ ] Complete TODO items in API documentation
- [ ] Finalize field mapping documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic for API failures

### Future Enhancement Ideas
- [ ] **Webhook Integration**: Real-time incident updates
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring dashboard
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated incident filtering
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Bulk field updates
- [ ] **Analytics**: Trend analysis and reporting
- [ ] **Mobile Notifications**: SMS or mobile app notifications

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **API Changes**: incident.io or FireHydrant API changes could break integration
   - *Mitigation*: Monitor API documentation, implement robust error handling
2. **Rate Limits**: API rate limiting could cause failures
   - *Mitigation*: Implement proper throttling and retry logic
3. **Email Delivery**: Email delivery failures could cause missed notifications
   - *Mitigation*: Implement fallback notification methods

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Google Apps Script Limits**: Execution time or quota limits
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize code, implement batching
2. **Data Volume**: Large numbers of incidents could cause performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination and efficient filtering

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [ ] System successfully identifies incidents with missing fields daily
- [ ] Email notifications are delivered reliably to all recipients
- [ ] Incident links work correctly and lead to the right incidents
- [ ] System handles all three business units (Square, Cash, Afterpay)

### Technical Success
- [ ] 99%+ uptime for daily executions
- [ ] <5 minute execution time for daily checks
- [ ] <1% API error rate
- [ ] Zero false positives in field validation

### Business Success
- [ ] Improved incident field completion rates
- [ ] Reduced manual effort in incident field validation
- [ ] Better incident data quality for analysis
- [ ] Stakeholder satisfaction with notification system
